# Laravel Forge `php-gmp` Recipe
Laravel Forge recipe which installs and configures [the GMP PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php) for the active version of PHP.

If you don't have a preference regarding PHP's mathematical extensions, go with [BCMath](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php); Forge installs that by default.
